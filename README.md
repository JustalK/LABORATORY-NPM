# LABORATORY-NPM

This project is my laboratory for playing with the package managaer `npm`. I have been using it for more than a decade now so I am quite familiar with it. Recently, I have been trying and playing with the different packages managers available such as `Yarn` and `Pnpm`. For understanding completely the pro and cons of Npm and why those new packages might be excellent alternative. I have made simple example exposing the fundamental problem in the way npm has been designed.
